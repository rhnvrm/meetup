# Meetup App - Udacity Nanodegree Project

A responsive web application that allows the user to establish a meet-up event. 

The goal was to create a demo app that is a joy to use on both desktop and mobile. The application allows someone to name their event, search for a host location, set the capacity of the event, the start and end times, and input a description of the event. The app does not have a real backend but makes use of the browser's local storage.
